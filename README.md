# foundation-range-slider-angular

## The Problem

Foundation has <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/range_slider.html">Range Sliders</a>. You want
 to use them. <a href="https://pineconellc.github.io/angular-foundation/">Angular Foundation</a> does not support them.
 This makes you sad.

Not to worry! Foundation Range-Slider Angular is here!
